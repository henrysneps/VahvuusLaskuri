# Overview
This project is a VBA based PowerPoint tool to help in counting and displaying available personnel in a military unit. Its primary purpose is to aid the duty officer to keep track of personnel and weapons moving in and out of a military unit by automating the manual counting process via an intuitive, quick to use user interface. The secondary purpose is to display this information in a PowerPoint slide, which can be formatted to look like a "reception info display" to provide an at-glance situation report of the unit's current status. See "use case example" for a better illustration of this idea.
