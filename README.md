# Overview
This project is a VBA based PowerPoint tool to help in counting and displaying available personnel and other assets in a military unit. Its primary purpose is to aid the duty officer to keep track of personnel and weapons moving in and out of a unit by automating the manual counting process via an intuitive, quick to use user interface. The secondary purpose is to display this information in a PowerPoint slide, which can be formatted to look like a "reception info display" to provide an at-glance situation report of the unit's current status. See "use case example" for a better illustration of this idea.

## Use case example

_The software being used in a reception-style info display._
  
  
Let's pretend you are the duty officer tasked to keep track of assets coming in and out of the unit...
 
- During your shift, a non-commisoned officer walks to you and reports: "1 officer, 3 non-commissioned officers, and 15 crew are leaving the unit with weapons."
 
- You immediately proceed to write this down by clicking the "Muokkaa Vahvuuksia"-button...

_After clickling the "Muokkaa Vahvuuksia"-button, an editor form pops up._

- From the editor form, you begin by subtracting the leaving personnel from the unit's strenght.

_The personnel leaving from the unit have been staged in the counter._

- You click the "V채henn채 Vahvuudesta (-)"-button to subtract the staged personnel from the unit's strenght.

_The unit's strenght has been now updated!_

- Next, you subtract the leaving weapons in a similar fashion...

_The leaving weapons have been staged._

_After clicking the "V채henn채 Vahvuudesta"-button, the same subtraction process happens to weapons._ 

- You close the form and give clearance to the non-commissioned officer leave the unit with the reported assets.

- Lastly, you double check that this information got updated to reception display...
